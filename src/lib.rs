//! # crunchyroll-rs
//!
//! A easy-to-use, batteries-included library for the undocumented
//! [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) beta api, completely written in Rust.
//!
//! You can use a premium account as well as a non-premium account to use this library, but you
//! will be limited to your account tier access privileges (=> you can't access a premium-only
//! series with a free account).
//!
//! The library has some features to ensure a flawless experience in a âš¡ðŸ¦€ blazingly fast
//! environment.
//! - Full [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) compatibility.
//! - Solid tests to [ensure api compatability](#implementation).
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Before you can do anything, you have to instantiate a new [`Crunchyroll`] struct at first. This
//! internally creates a new [`crunchyroll::CrunchyrollBuilder`] instance. All functions of this
//! struct are chaining, which means you can build a working Crunchyroll instance in one expression.
//!
//! ```
//! use crunchyroll_rs::{Crunchyroll, Locale};
//!
//! let crunchy = Crunchyroll::builder()
//!     // set the language in which results should be returned
//!     .locale(Locale::en_US)
//!     // login with user credentials (other login options are also available)
//!     .login_with_credentials("username", "password")
//!     .await?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Request media
//!
//! You can request media like series, episodes, movies, ... with their corresponding function in
//! the [`Crunchyroll`] struct. Use `Crunchyroll::*_from_id` to get them while `*` is the media type.
//!
//! Every media type has the parent struct [`Media`] which takes a generic that represents the type
//! of the media. [`Media<Season>`] would represent a season for example.
//!
//! ```
//! let series = crunchy
//!     // get the series with the id 'GY8VEQ95Y'
//!     .series_from_id("GY8VEQ95Y")
//!     .await?;
//!
//! let episode = crunchy
//!     // get the episode with the id 'GRDKJZ81Y'
//!     .episode_from_id("GRDKJZ81Y")
//!     .await?;
//!
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to get the children of a "container" media like a series or season, these types
//! implements the appropriate functions to archive this.
//!
//! ```
//! let seasons = series
//!     // get the seasons of this episode
//!     .seasons()
//!     .await?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Streaming
//!
//! This crate allows you to get the actual video streams behind episodes and movies. With
//! [`Media<Episode>::streams`] and [`Media<Movie>::streams`] you get access to the streams. The
//! returning struct [`media::VideoStream`] has all required information to access the streams.
//!
//! ```
//! let streams = episode
//!     .streams()
//!     .await?;
//! ```
//!
//! Crunchyroll uses the [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) and
//! [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) video streaming
//! formats to distribute their streams. The logic to work with this formats is already implemented
//! into this crate (it uses the _HLS_ stream backend).
//!
//! ```
//! let streaming_data = streams
//!     .streaming_data()
//!     .await?;
//!
//! // sort the streams to get the stream with the best resolution at first
//! streaming_data.sort_by(|a, b| a.resolution.width.cmp(&b.resolution.width).reverse());
//!
//! let sink = &mut std::io::sink();
//!
//! // get the segments / video chunks of the first stream (which is the best after it got sorted
//! // above)
//! let segments = streaming_data[0].segments().await?;
//! // iterate through every segment and write it to the provided writer (which is a sink in this
//! // case; it drops its input immediately). writer can be anything which implements `std::io::Write`
//! // like a file, a pipe, ...
//! for segment in segments {
//!     segment.write_to(sink).await?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Note:** The `stream` feature must be enable to process / write streams (enabled by default).
//!
//! # Implementation
//! Because Crunchyroll does not have a fixed api versioning and is currently in its beta phase,
//! changes are likely to happen (even though they weren't very radical in the past) so keep an eye
//! on the version of this library to get new updates and potential fixes.
//!
//! To ensure at least all existing parts of the library are working as expected, a special feature
//! only for testing is implemented. When running tests with the `__test_strict` feature, it ensures
//! that no fields were added or removed from an api response, otherwise the associated test will
//! fail.
